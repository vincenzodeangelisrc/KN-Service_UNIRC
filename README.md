# KN-Service_UNIRC
Implementation of the KN-Service presented in the research work "An anonymous protocol for short communications in social networks and its application to proximity-based services"

To run the simulation:
1) Lunch the server-side module (a web-server as Tomcat is required).
2) Lunch "SimulationClientSide" on the client-side module by setting the proper simulation parameters.
3) Lunch "SimulationStart" on the client-side module to start the simulation.
